== About ==
  The Owl Platform Motion Locator Solver (motion-locator) is a "solver"
  according to the GRAIL platform definitions.  It is also an ongoing research
  project, and so may contain non-essential components (GUIs, logging, etc.)
  which are intended for algorithmic analysis.  The solver requires both a
  World Model server and a "fingerprint solver" (to generate transient RSSI
  statistics) in order to operate correctly.

  More information about the GRAIL architecture can be found at
  the GRAIL developer wiki (<http://grailrtls.sf.net>) or the GRAIL@Rutgers
  homepage (<http://grail.rutgers.edu>).

== Compiling ==
  Motion Locator should be compiled using the Apache Maven project management
  tool.  The project is currently compatible with Apache Maven version 3,
  which can be downloaded for free at <http://maven.apache.org/>.  To build
  the static JAR file output, the following command should be run from the
  project root (where the pom.xml file is located):

    mvn clean install -U

  If everything compiles correctly, then near the end of the Maven output,
  this line should appear:

    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

  In this case, the JAR file will be located in the ``target'' subdirectory.
  If not, please visit the project website listed at the top of this
  document for support.

== Running ==

  Motion Locator must be run directly from the Java launcher (java or
  java.exe).

  To run via the Java launcher directly, you only need to include the path to
  the Jar file:

    java -jar path/to/motion-locator-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

  SigVis takes an required set of parameters to connect to a remote Owl/GRAIL
  World Model server on startup.  To do so, specify the World Model host/IP,
  client port, and a region name as commandline parameters:

    java -jar path/to/motion-locator-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
      grail.mydomain.com 7010 myregion
