        <h1>Passive Motion Localization</h1>

        <p>This Owl Platform solver uses RSSI variance data, combined with the locations of transmitters and receivers, to determine the location of motion within an area of interest.</p>

        <h2>Tracking without Training</h2>
        <p>The solver is both an ongoing research project and a solver for the
        <a href="http://www.owlplatform.com">Owl Platform</a>. The primary
        goal is to obtain device-free motion localization for "free" in
        situations where device (active) localization is already possible. By
        free I mean that there shouldn't be any additional set-up or data
        collection required beyond what is necessary for active localization.</p>

        <p>The current version works on a very simple principle: as objects
        move around in an RF-rich environment, they can cause interference
        with the radio waves.  This interference is observable by receivers in
        the form of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) fluctuations.
        By computing the short-term (3-5 second) variance of the RSSI value,
        and knowing the location of some transmitters and receivers (already
        necessary for active localization), it is possible to approximate the
        location of the interfering motion using a simple
        lines-intersecting-tiles technique.</p>

        <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Indoor RF propagation paths are far from simple. In fact,
        multiple-path propagation effects make communication, tracking, and
        other radio-based technologies much more difficult than outdoor or in
        "free space".  However, in many indoor environments, two general
        properties can be observed: (1) the human body strongly influences the
        propagation of RF signals in the 1-2.4GHz range, and (2) line-of-sight
        signal propagation estimation is slightly inaccurate, but very
        inexpensive.</p>

        <p>To exploit these two observations, the algorithm works like this:
        <ol>
          <li>Partition the space into an evenly-sized grid of rectangular
          "tiles". Each tile will overlap its neighboring tiles by 50% (to
          somewhat reduce aliasing effects).</li>
          <li>Compute the standard deviation of the RSSI value from every
          transmitter to every receiver where the link distance is &le;30m.
          Trimming long links helps to elminate variances caused by random
          effects.</li>
          <li>Compute a "score" for each tile based on the value of each link
          that passes over it.  The link is assumed to follow a straight path
          between the locations of the transmitter and receiver.  Details are
          not provided here, but are available in the source code.</li>
          <li>Over the entire set of tiles, identify those tiles whose score
          is a local maximum and filter based on a minimum threshold.</li>
          <li>The tiles that remain are predictions of the location of motion
          in the area.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>While the algorithm is rather crude and simplistic, it works
        surprisingly well.  Without needing to train the algorithm for
        specific environmental conditions, <a
          href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/research/technical_reports/reports.php?action=view&series_id=1&report_id=674"
          title="Rutgers University DCS Technical Report 674" alt="Rutgers
          University DCS Technical Report 674">experimental results</a> showed that it
        could achieve 90% correct localization of motion for up to 3
        individuals with reasonable accuracy and low false positive rates.</p>

        <h2>Continuing Work</h2>
        <p>As it is a research project, and a bit of a hobby of mine, I
        continue to work on improving the results and trying new ideas.
        Currently I'm working with convolution matrices to try and reduce the
        area identifying the motion without sacrificing the accuracy or
        recall.</p>
